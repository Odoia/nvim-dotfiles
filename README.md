# üß† Neovim Project Setup for Rails

This guide ensures your Neovim environment (with your custom dotfiles) works 100% in any new Rails project.

## ‚úÖ Requirements Check

Run this to ensure all core tools are installed:

```bash
node -v && echo "Node OK" || echo "Node Missing"
ruby -v && echo "Ruby OK" || echo "Ruby Missing"
npm -v && echo "NPM OK" || echo "NPM Missing"
nvim --version | head -n 1
```

You should also have:
